# Project Management  

Organization of work. Very common to use agile project management, where we work in sprints.  

#### The Agile Workflow  

**Sprints**: organize tasks based on sprints, which last a few weeks.  
- Sprint planning at the beginning of the sprint.  
- Sprint review at the end of each sprint.  
- Sprint retrospective.  

**Daily scrums**: standup meetings.  

> Product backlog ->  
> Sprint backlog ->  
> Sprint (planning - implementation - review (+ daily scrums) - retrospective) ->  
> Completed Project.  

**Scrumboard**: a taskboard.  
- Each member assigned tasks for different projects or separate features on the same project.  
- tasks to complete are often called issues or stories.
